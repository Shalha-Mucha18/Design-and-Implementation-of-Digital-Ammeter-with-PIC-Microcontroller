# Digital Ammeter Design and Implementation with PIC Microcontroller
## Overview
This repository contains the design and implementation details of a Digital Ammeter using a PIC Microcontroller. A digital ammeter is an instrument used to measure current flow in amperes and display current levels on a digital display. These devices provide valuable information about current consumption and current flow patterns, aiding users in troubleshooting irregular loads and trends. The design of this digital ammeter utilizes the PIC16F877A Microcontroller.
## Project Details
### Components Used:
- PIC16F877A Microcontroller
- Current Sensor (e.g., Hall Effect Sensor)
- Display Module (e.g., LCD Display)
- Supporting electronic components (resistors, capacitors, etc.)
### Features:
- Accurate measurement of current flow
- Digital display for easy reading
- Real-time monitoring of current levels
- Customizable settings for calibration and sensitivity
- Low power consumption
### Implementation:
- **Hardware Design:** The hardware setup involves connecting the PIC Microcontroller to the current sensor and display module, along with necessary support components.
- **Software Development:** Firmware is developed for the PIC Microcontroller to interface with the current sensor, process the measured data, and drive the display module.
- **Calibration:** The system is calibrated to ensure accurate measurement of current levels. This may involve adjusting parameters in the firmware or through user interface settings.
- **Testing and Validation:** The digital ammeter is tested under various conditions to verify its accuracy and reliability. This includes testing with different load scenarios and comparing the readings with known standards.
